HTML Structure

Created an index.html file.
Tried to add content/text with and without the tags in the file.
Created an assests folder with an image folder in it.
An favicon image dropped in the images folder.
Added the favicon to the html file in the head tag.
All the changes were commited through git commands and file has executed well in the web browser as expected.
